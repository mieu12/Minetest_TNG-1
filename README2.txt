The NeXt Game for the MGE [minetest_tng]
========================================
Version 16.09

To use this game with Minetest, insert this repository as
  /games/minetest_tng
in the Minetest Engine.

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Introduction
------------
I decided to fork Minetest NeXt by BlockMen, because BlockMen no longer does
anything about Minetest :(. I changed the title of the game to
Minetest TNG - The NeXt Game. This game should be like Minetest NeXt a
lightweight, but powerful survival game. Hunger and mobs are already added!

Of course I would really like to hear your ideas and suggestions!
